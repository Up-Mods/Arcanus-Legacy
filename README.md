### Learning Spells:
In order to learn Spells, you need to find Spell Books. These can be found in Village Libraries, Stronghold Libraries, and Ruined Portal chests. When you read a Spell Book, you will learn how to cast a spell.
<br><br>
Spell Books contain the Pattern that defines a given Spell.

### Spell Casting:
Casting Spells requires that you know a given Spell. All you have to do is have a Wand in your main hand, and use the Left and Right Mouse Buttons to create the Pattern of a Spell.

### Mana Flasks:
Mana Flasks are a way for Mages to store Mana for later. In order to fill a Mana Flask, all you have to do is Sneak + hold Right Click, while having at least 5 Mana available.

### Display Case:
Display Cases are decorative blocks that can hold any item. To open or close them, all you have to do is Shift + Right Click them, and to place an item in them all you have to do is Right Click it while it's open with the item you wish to place inside.

Display Cases also are able to emit a Comparator output depending on whether they're open or closed.

You can use `/spells list` at any time to see all the spells, as well as their patterns, that you know.
